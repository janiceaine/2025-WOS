    <h2>About Me: </h2>
    <p>
        Hi! I am born and rasied in East Africa, Uganda. I speak 3 other languages native to Uganda aside from English and the budding computer langauges.
        I am an ambivert that enjoys working out, watching anime, and eating good food.
        I love tinkering with technology and cars to see what breaks them or makes them work so I can maintain them well. My dream is to become a professional
        software developer and create digital footprints of technology that impacts the world we live in by solving everyday problems.
