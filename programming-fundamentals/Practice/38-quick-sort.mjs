  Create a function that uses the partition function from yesterday to fully sort an array in-place.

  This is an unstable sort.

  Time Complexity:
    - Best: O(n log(n)) — linearithmic.
    - Average: O(n log(n)) — linearithmic.
    - Worst: O(n^2) — quadratic.
  
  Space Complexity: O(1) — constant.

  Steps:
    - Left by partitioning the entire array using the partition algorithm.
    - Recursively apply partitioning to the sub-array to the left of the returned partition index.
    - Recursively apply partitioning to the sub-array to the right of the returned partition index.
